# UnrealTuber-AI-TTS
The development of the UnrealTuber application is taking too long. So, I have decided to release each module separately and independently to fast-track accessibility. Find all available modules [here](https://github.com/stars/leromango/lists/unrealtuber).

One of these modules is AI-TTS, which offers a unique feature allowing you to design AI characters, complete with distinct personalities and voices. These characters can be interacted with during your live streams at the simple press of a button. They respond in real-time, fully in character, with a natural-sounding voice.

The AI-TTS module is versatile and customizable. A variety of settings are readily exposed, enabling you to tweak and adjust the AI to suit your preferences and needs.

In the future, I plan to expand the module's capabilities even further. Soon, features like Twitch Chat integration and a queue system will be available.

## Installation
1. Make sure that you have Python installed.
2. Set up an OpenAI account and an ElevenLabs account. If you want to use Azure, set up an Azure account as well.
3. Create a voice you want via ElevenLabs.
4. Simply download the repository or clone it into a folder.
5. Navigate into your folder within the terminal or open the terminal in the folder.
6. Install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements`.
7. If you want to use an interactive setup, delete `config.json`. **INTERACTIVE SETUP IS RECOMMENDED!** You can also open and edit the config file on your own.
8. After you are done, you can run the script with `python AI-tts.py`.
## Usage
 - Press the button you used during the setup to activate the bot.
 - Start talking!
 - Wait for the reply.
